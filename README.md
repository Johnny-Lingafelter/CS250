* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I think that the best way to interpret user needs is to host some sort of focus group and directly ask users what functionality they expect from a program.
If there is an existing system that is in use it would also be helpful to watch users while they use the system to get a feel for what they expect from it. 
In general, I think that a "hands on" approach to defining user needs is better than simply reading requirements and trying to implement them how you personally understand them. This can leave too much room for error and confusion and may end up not meeting the expectations of the user. 
User stories are helpful in this process because they specifically address a single piece of functionality.
User stories define who is using it, what they expect to happen, and why they want to do it.

* How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Currently, I approach developing programs by thouroughly reading the requirements and trying to piece together something that meets those requirements.
I love the agile processes of incremental development, and I do think that I have in the past used this practice by writing very small bits of code at a time 
and immediately testing the functionality to check for errors. In the same vien, Test Driven Development makes a lot of sense to me and I am excited to use it in the future.
I hope to incorporate daily stand-up meetings in future development work as well. This is something I have never done, even though I have worked on teams before.
It is very important to be in constant communication with your team so that you can always be on the same page.

* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me, being a good team member means constantly thinking about the team as a whole rather than just thinking about what you have to get done.
You must be aware of what everyone on the team is working on, and be thinking and talking about how what you are working on will integrate with the team's work.
It is also helpful to be available to help others that are stuck on something, as well as knowing that you could ask for help when you are stuck.
